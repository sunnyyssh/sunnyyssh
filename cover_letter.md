Hi! I am Bulat Bagaviev and my dream is to join the Google team. I am sure that 


Dear Google Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Summer Internship Program at Google as a backend developer. With my passion for distributed systems, strong foundation in backend technologies, and hands-on experience in building scalable solutions, I believe I can bring value to your team while gaining valuable experience working at the cutting edge of technology.

As a .NET backend developer, I have worked on designing microservices, implementing event-driven architectures using RabbitMQ, and ensuring robust communication between services. In a recent project, I tackled the challenge of integrating message brokers into microservices to optimize asynchronous communication, which allowed me to strengthen my understanding of message queuing and distributed communication systems.

During my studies and personal projects, I have also gained in-depth knowledge of multithreading, concurrency, and the CAP theorem. Exploring these topics further through Paxos and Raft consensus algorithms has deepened my understanding of fault-tolerant systems and data consistency challenges in distributed systems. Additionally, I have practical experience working with Docker and Kubernetes, which has allowed me to deploy and manage scalable applications in containerized environments.

Beyond my technical skills, I am a collaborative team player with experience working on cross-functional teams. For a recent project, I collaborated with a frontend developer to build a web service where I was responsible for designing the backend architecture, optimizing database queries, and ensuring secure authentication using JWT tokens.

Google’s commitment to innovation and solving complex technical challenges aligns with my aspirations as a developer. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a talented team, learn from industry leaders, and contribute to impactful projects that reach millions of users globally.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to the success of Google’s Summer Internship Program.

Sincerely,
Bulat Bagaviev
